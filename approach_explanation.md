# Approach Explanation for Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Overview

Our solution implements a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline that combines rule-based methods with machine learning to extract and prioritize relevant sections from document collections based on specific personas and their jobs-to-be-done.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Document Structure Extraction
We employ a hybrid approach for outline extraction that handles diverse PDF formats:
- **Font-based detection**: Analyzes font sizes, styles, and relative differences to identify headings
- **Pattern matching**: Uses regex patterns to detect common heading formats (numbered, lettered, named sections)
- **Structural analysis**: Examines spacing, positioning, and document layout to infer hierarchy
- **Adaptive OCR**: Automatically detects and processes scanned pages when native text extraction fails

Our ensemble voting system combines predictions from multiple strategies, ensuring robust heading detection across varied document types including academic papers, business reports, and technical documentation.

### 2. Persona and Job Analysis
The system deeply analyzes persona descriptions and job requirements through:
- **NLP-based parsing**: Extracts roles, domains, and expertise levels using NLTK
- **Keyword expansion**: Enriches search terms with synonyms and related concepts
- **Context understanding**: Identifies focus areas and technical requirements
- **Query profile building**: Creates a comprehensive search profile combining persona attributes with job-specific needs

### 3. Multi-Layer Ranking Engine
Our ranking system employs a cascade approach for optimal efficiency:
- **Fast filtering (TF-IDF/BM25)**: Quickly eliminates irrelevant content using statistical methods
- **Semantic understanding**: Uses sentence transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 80MB) to capture meaning beyond keywords
- **Cross-document validation**: Boosts sections appearing across multiple documents
- **Ensemble scoring**: Combines multiple signals with learned weights for final ranking

### 4. Intelligent Subsection Extraction
We extract granular content through:
- **Paragraph-based chunking**: Preserves natural content boundaries
- **Semantic segmentation**: Groups related sentences for coherent extraction
- **Sliding window approach**: Ensures complete coverage of important content
- **Relevance-based selection**: Prioritizes chunks with high information density

## Key Innovations

1. **Adaptive Processing**: The system automatically adjusts its strategies based on document characteristics
2. **Efficiency Optimization**: Progressive filtering and caching ensure processing within 60-second limit
3. **Generic Architecture**: Works across diverse domains without retraining
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Every decision includes confidence metrics for transparency

## Performance Optimizations

- **Batch processing**: Encodes multiple text segments simultaneously
- **Embedding cache**: Reuses computed embeddings to reduce redundant calculations
- **Parallel extraction**: Processes multiple PDFs concurrently
- **Early stopping**: Skips detailed analysis for clearly irrelevant sections

Our solution balances accuracy with efficiency, leveraging both traditional NLP techniques and modern transformer models while respecting the 1GB model size constraint and CPU-only execution requirement.
